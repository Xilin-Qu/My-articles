        <h1>Yet another way to say '主食'</h1>
        <p>Growing up in a Chinese family, I've always been haunted by two questions. Any ideas for dinner? And '主食吃啥?'</P>
        <p>'主食' is such an essential element to a meal that a Chinese person would have a hard time believing a meal is complete if no '主食' was served.</p>
        <p>In the context of Chinese culinary culture, especially from the perspective of a northerner like me, '主食' refers to anything that's made from flour or rice. Some of the examples may be rice, noodle, rice noodle and Mantou (steamed fluffy doughs that serve a similar role as bread).</P>
        <p>Another layer of significance the word '主食' carries is that it is something that makes you feel stuffed and that it is 'the foundation of a proper meal'.</p>
        <p>So how do we explain this concept in English?</p>
        <p>Some, like this Sohu article, argue that an equivalent hypernym cannot be found in English. One should simply ask 'would you like rice, bread or noodle?', instead of trying to find an umbrella term that covers all three. Others believe that 'staple food' delivers the same meaning as '主食'. This statement is not groundless, as my Scottish flatmate said he could see what I meant by 'staple food'. But this Reddit thread apparently suggests that 'staple food' has a much broader definition than 'things made from flour or rice that make you feel stuffed'. In that thread, people talked about vegetables and various proteins as staples and it can be deduced that 'staples' means things that appear very frequently on your dining table, including but not limited to foods that give you Carbs.</p>
        <p>It dawned on me when I went to the gym the other day to face the daily interrogation from my PT that '主食' can be said in another way. My PT asked me:'What carbs have you eaten today?' That's it, carbs. It encapsulates quite well what '主食' says about the nature of this kind of food: things that are starchy and give you carbohydrate.</p>
        <p>Another possible translation of '主食' can be found here on this NHS page. Starchy food. I double checked with my PT to see if something like 'what starchy foods do you eat' sound natural to native English speakers, and he said yes.</p>
        <p>So there we have it, two alternative ways to translate '主食' into English. Let me know what you think. Do you agree with these renderings? Is there a better version? Any feedback is greatly appreciated. </p>
